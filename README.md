# SpringerBookArith04

This repository contains the Verilog files and other ancillary files from my Spring 2004 textbook.  Since I cannot seem to find the code on Springer anymore, I thought it would be nice to have here who purchase my textbook but somehow the CD is missing.  Any questions, let me know.
