# SpringerBookArith04

This repository contains the Verilog files and other ancillary files from my Spring 2004 textbook.  Since I cannot seem to find the code on Springer anymore, I thought it would be nice to have here who purchase my textbook but somehow the CD is missing.  

When I originally created the book, I heavily used primitives.  Today, there is probably no need to do this and I could have probably saved some space and created more efficiency.  I am hoping this leads to a future textbook with more advanced designs.  

Enjoy!  Any questions, comments or suggestions, let me know.
